      Poem I.
      Inner Reflections of a software engineer in training
      </p>
    <p> 
      As I sit in the whimsical calm brought by the clicking sound of my fingers pressing on my laptop keys, the melody of Bach's Cello Suite No.1 plays subtly, and I take a moment to observe the stillness of nature's perfect silent symphony. I look out my window with conscious intention and see the most beautiful and magnificent special effects my eyes have seen: the flight of birds, the invisible movement of the wind against the palm trees. I see the branches sway gracefully and become keenly aware that this extraordinary mother ship called Earth travels across space at 67,000 miles per hour. Meanwhile, life is completely unaware of her traveling speed, we remain safe from asteroids and meteors, yet Earth continues to rotate around her father sun to breathe new life into all that grows. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      I observe nature's silent symphony and feel deeply moved at the long plight Earth has before her, how can I, just a mere human, help in the recovery of her raison dâ€™etre? For years and years, humanity's careless, neglectful existence has omitted the Earth as a living being. Gaia has been painfully charged as a safe keeper of humankind through negligent and polluting cruelty. Yet, she joyfully carries the weight of all life residing within her womb and continues to resurge amidst the circumstances humans placed her in. Can you see, the earth is a Supreme Mother? She waits for your heart in resistance, praying the life she keeps within her will rectify its harmful behavior. She waits for us, through the harshest conditions, she remains in gentle mother love, resisting the effects of changing climates, for the sake of preserving all that is alive within her. Gaia would cease to exist if it meant protecting all beings within her. In her mother mercy, Gaia continues to feed and provide the human experience with the elements that consist of being alive, air, food, water, so not just a few, but all sentient beings, in the sky, on the earth, underwater, and in places yet to be explored, can live and thrive, alive.
